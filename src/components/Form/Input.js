Here you can create your controlled and uncontrolled Input.

Hints:
- To make this component uncontrolled from the outer components the state should be managed internally somewhere in this component.
- To make this component controlled it should receive a prop with the value to display in the input. 
- If the Input receives the value prop then it should be controlled, if it doesn't receive the value prop then it should be uncontrolled.
- You can add the class form-control to your Input to encapsulate the style. This way you can use 
  <Input value={someValue} onChange={handleChange} /> and the style becomes an implementation detail of Input
